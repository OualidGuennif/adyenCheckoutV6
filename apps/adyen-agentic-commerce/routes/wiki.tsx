            <h2>Merchant-first architecture</h2>
            <p>
              Agentic commerce delegates discovery and purchase intent, but the merchant retains
              catalogue truth, policy enforcement, human confirmation rules and an auditable
              mandate. Provider adapters sit behind a narrow interface so protocols can change
              without rewriting payment or fulfilment logic.
            </p>

          <section id="auth">
            <h2>Authentication</h2>
            <p>
              Adyen Checkout keeps its API key server-side and exposes only the publishable TEST
              client key to Adyen Web. Any future agent-provider bearer remains encrypted
              server-side. A token never proves an endpoint or schema: both must come from the
              pilot's authoritative contract.

          <section id="mock">
            <h2>Local mock contract</h2>
            <p>
              The mock runs deterministic intent capture, merchant policy and catalogue ranking.
              External agent reasoning is a fixture with <code>status=simulated</code>,
              <code>provider=null</code> and{" "}
              <code>calledExternalProvider=false</code>. It is not presented as an OpenAI, Copilot,
              Google or Adyen response.

            <h2>Human-confirmed payment handoff</h2>
            <p>
              After reviewing the offer, the user can explicitly create a standard Checkout API v72
              session and complete it with Adyen Web 6.41.0. This is a real Adyen TEST online
              payment call when credentials are configured, but it is not described as an Agentic
              Commerce API call.
            </p>

          <section id="limits">
            <h2>Current availability</h2>
            <Callout title="Pilot status" tone="warning">
              Adyen's current public material describes payment support for OpenAI, Google and
              Microsoft surfaces as pilot-phase. No public TEST API schema was verifiable for this
              implementation, so Real Agentic mode returns an explicit 501 without making a request.
