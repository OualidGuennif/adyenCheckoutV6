# Adyen V6 Styling

A workbench for theming the Adyen Web Drop-in. The checkout is live on the left, every option Adyen
exposes is on the right, and it re-renders as you change things. Copy the result out as a JSON
config, a CSS file, or both.

No orders, no back office, no database rows — it creates a TEST session, mounts a Drop-in, and keeps
your panel settings in `localStorage`.

## Quick start

```bash
cp .env.example .env      # then fill in the three Adyen values below
deno task dev             # http://localhost:8000
```

From the repository root, `deno task dev:styling` runs it on port 8004 alongside the other three
playgrounds.

| Task              | What it does                                                      |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `deno task dev`   | Development server with hot reload.                               |
| `deno task build` | Production build.                                                 |
| `deno task start` | Serve a build.                                                    |
| `deno task test`  | Tests, including the CSS token audit (needs network — see below). |
| `deno task check` | Format, lint and type-check.                                      |

## Environment variables

Copy `.env.example` to `.env`. **Only the first three need a value from you.**

### You must set these

| Variable                 | Where to get it                                                                                                                      |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `ADYEN_API_KEY`          | Customer Area → Developers → API credentials, **TEST**. Server-side only; never reaches the browser.                                 |
| `ADYEN_MERCHANT_ACCOUNT` | Your TEST merchant account name, e.g. `YourCompanyECOM`.                                                                             |
| `ADYEN_CLIENT_KEY`       | Same API credential page. Must start with `test_`, and the **origin below must be allow-listed on it** or the Drop-in will not load. |

### Set these only when you deploy

| Variable                 | Default if unset                                        | When it matters                                                                                                                                                   |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `PUBLIC_ORIGIN`          | `http://localhost:<PORT>`                               | The exact origin browsers use. It anchors the CSRF check — a mismatch turns every request into a 403. Must also be allow-listed on your client key.               |
| `PROFILE_ENCRYPTION_KEY` | A key file next to the database, generated on first run | Encrypts profiles added through the UI. **Required** on Render or Deno Deploy — the app refuses to save a profile without it. 32-byte Base64 or 64-character hex. |
| `SESSION_SIGNING_SECRET` | A new random value on every boot                        | Signs the session and CSRF cookies. Fine to leave unset locally; without it, restarting logs everyone out and two instances reject each other's cookies.          |

### Rarely worth touching

| Variable                                      | Default                 | Notes                                                                                   |
| --------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `PORT`                                        | `8000`                  | Render sets this for you.                                                               |
| `DATABASE_PATH`                               | `./data/styling.sqlite` | Only holds profiles in this app.                                                        |
| `PLAYGROUND_BASIC_AUTH_USER` / `..._PASSWORD` | off                     | Puts the whole playground behind Basic Auth. Worth setting if the deployment is public. |

This app needs **no HMAC key and no webhook**: it never takes a payment to completion server-side,
so there is nothing to notify.

## What the three panel tabs do

- **Field styles** — the `styles` object. The card number, expiry and security code render inside
  Adyen-hosted iframes, so no page CSS can reach them; this object is the only way to style them.
  Four states: base, placeholder, error, validated.
- **Components** — the configuration objects: Drop-in behaviour, card fields, and Apple Pay / Google
  Pay / PayPal. Wallet buttons are drawn by the provider, so neither your CSS nor the field styles
  reach them — only each vendor's own options do.
- **Theme** — the `--adyen-sdk-*` custom properties Adyen Web reads. This is the supported way to
  theme everything outside the secured fields.

The **theme picker** next to the market selectors applies a whole look at once. _Adyen default_
changes nothing at all; _Mono_, _Contrast_ and _Soft_ are starting points you can then edit — the
picker falls back to _Custom_ as soon as you do.

At the bottom of the Theme tab, **Class-name rules** targets Adyen's internal class names. It is
marked in red because those names are private API: they can be renamed in any release, with no
deprecation, and a checkout styled that way can break on an upgrade. Prefer a token wherever one
exists.

Your whole configuration survives a reload. **Reset** is the only thing that clears it, and it asks
first.

## Exports

Both are copy-or-download, at the bottom of the relevant tab:

- a JSON config to pass to `AdyenCheckout` / `Dropin`
- a CSS file to import **after** `@adyen/adyen-web/styles/adyen.css`

## About the token audit test

`components/adyenOptions.test.ts` fetches the real `adyen.css` for the pinned SDK version and fails
if the panel offers a custom property Adyen no longer reads, or misses one it added. That is
deliberate: merchants paste this output into production stylesheets, so an SDK bump should not pass
quietly. **It needs network access** — offline it fails on the fetch, not on a real regression.

## Docker

```bash
docker build -f apps/adyen-v6-styling/Dockerfile -t adyen-styling:test .
docker run --rm --env-file apps/adyen-v6-styling/.env -p 8000:8000 adyen-styling:test
```

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom                                              | Cause                                                                                        |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Drop-in never appears                                | The client key does not allow-list `PUBLIC_ORIGIN`, or it does not start with `test_`.       |
| Every action returns 403                             | `PUBLIC_ORIGIN` does not match the host in the browser's address bar.                        |
| "The provided session identifier or data is invalid" | Adyen sessions are single-use. Use **New payment** after a completed one.                    |
| Apple Pay button missing                             | Apple Pay only renders in Safari, on a verified domain, with your own Apple sandbox account. |
