# Adyen Digital

An online checkout playground covering five integration paths against Adyen TEST, with a Back Office
that correlates what each one produced.

- **Sessions** — the recommended Drop-in flow
- **Advanced** — `/paymentMethods` + `/payments` + `/payments/details`, driven by the component
- **API only** — server-to-server with Adyen's encrypted card fields
- **MIT** — merchant-initiated, using a stored payment method
- **Pay by Link** — a hosted link, followed through to its webhook

## Quick start

```bash
cp .env.example .env      # then fill in the four Adyen values below
deno task dev             # http://localhost:8000
```

From the repository root, `deno task dev:digital` runs it on port 8001.

| Task              | What it does                        |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `deno task dev`   | Development server with hot reload. |
| `deno task build` | Production build.                   |
| `deno task start` | Serve a build.                      |
| `deno task test`  | Tests.                              |
| `deno task check` | Format, lint and type-check.        |

Health routes: `/healthz` and `/api/health`.

## Environment variables

Copy `.env.example` to `.env`. **Only the first four need a value from you.**

### You must set these

| Variable                 | Where to get it                                                                                                          |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `ADYEN_API_KEY`          | Customer Area → Developers → API credentials, **TEST**. Server-side only.                                                |
| `ADYEN_MERCHANT_ACCOUNT` | Your TEST merchant account name, e.g. `YourCompanyECOM`.                                                                 |
| `ADYEN_CLIENT_KEY`       | Same credential page. Must start with `test_`, and `PUBLIC_ORIGIN` must be allow-listed on it.                           |
| `ADYEN_HMAC_KEY`         | Customer Area → Developers → Webhooks → your webhook → HMAC key. Without it, incoming webhooks are rejected as unsigned. |

### Set these only when you deploy

| Variable                 | Default if unset                                        | When it matters                                                                                                                                                       |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `PUBLIC_ORIGIN`          | `http://localhost:<PORT>`                               | The exact origin browsers use. Anchors the CSRF check and builds the return URLs Adyen redirects back to. Also where your webhook points: `${PUBLIC_ORIGIN}/webhook`. |
| `PROFILE_ENCRYPTION_KEY` | A key file next to the database, generated on first run | Encrypts profiles added through the UI. **Required** on Render or Deno Deploy. 32-byte Base64 or 64-character hex.                                                    |
| `SESSION_SIGNING_SECRET` | A new random value on every boot                        | Signs the session and CSRF cookies. Without it, restarting logs everyone out.                                                                                         |

### Rarely worth touching

| Variable                                      | Default                 | Notes                                                                                    |
| --------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `PORT`                                        | `8000`                  | Render sets this for you.                                                                |
| `DATABASE_PATH`                               | `./data/digital.sqlite` | Orders, attempts, webhooks and the API log. Needs a persistent disk to survive a deploy. |
| `PLAYGROUND_BASIC_AUTH_USER` / `..._PASSWORD` | off                     | Puts the whole playground behind Basic Auth. Worth setting if the deployment is public.  |

## Webhooks

Point a **TEST** standard webhook at `${PUBLIC_ORIGIN}/webhook` and copy its HMAC key into
`ADYEN_HMAC_KEY`.

Locally that address is not reachable from Adyen, so use a tunnel (`cloudflared`, `ngrok`) and set
`PUBLIC_ORIGIN` to the tunnel URL. Without a webhook the payment flows still work — you just will
not see the asynchronous half: captures, refunds, chargebacks and Pay by Link completion.

Redelivery is safe. Webhooks are deduplicated and lifecycle actions are idempotent, both enforced by
unique database constraints rather than by retry logic.

## Where things live

The side panel on the Drop-in and Component pages keeps callbacks, API calls and webhooks, redacted.
The Back Office shows the timeline and explains why a lifecycle action is unavailable rather than
hiding it.

Per-method capabilities — what can be captured, refunded, cancelled — live in
[`packages/platform/payment-methods.ts`](../../packages/platform/payment-methods.ts) and are meant
to be edited without touching flow code.

## Docker and Render

```bash
docker build -f apps/adyen-digital/Dockerfile -t adyen-digital:test .
docker run --rm --env-file apps/adyen-digital/.env -p 8000:8000 adyen-digital:test
```

The local `render.yaml` describes this service on its own; the one at the repository root deploys
all four together. This app needs a persistent disk — it is the one that stores orders.
