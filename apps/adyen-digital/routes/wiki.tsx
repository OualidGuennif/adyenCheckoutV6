              Create a <code>POST /sessions</code> request on the server and pass only the returned
              <code>id</code> and <code>sessionData</code>{" "}
              to Adyen Web. The final outcome is asynchronous and must be reconciled from the
              AUTHORISATION webhook.

              With v6.41.0, card installments for Sessions belong in the request-level
              <code>installmentOptions</code>. Checkout API v72 accepts an expiry up to 24 hours;
              the default session expiry is one hour.
            </p>
          </section>
          <section id="advanced">
            <h2>Advanced Flow</h2>
            <p>
              The browser calls your backend for <code>/paymentMethods</code>,{" "}
              <code>/payments</code>
              and{" "}
              <code>/payments/details</code>. The component callback resolves with the backend
              response so Adyen Web can handle redirects, 3DS2 or QR/voucher actions.
            </p>
            <p>
              Drop-in is the all-in-one surface; Components let you mount one payment method. Both
              have the same rule: API keys and merchant credentials stay server-side.
            </p>
          </section>
          <section id="callbacks">
            <h2>Frontend callbacks</h2>
            <p>
              Core callbacks include <code>onSubmit</code>, <code>onAdditionalDetails</code>,
              <code>onPaymentCompleted</code>, <code>onPaymentFailed</code>, <code>onError</code>,
              <code>onChange</code>{" "}
              and payment-method-specific events. This playground records chronological, sanitized
              snapshots. Encrypted fields, sessionData and card data are redacted.
            </p>
            <p>
              Adyen Web 6.41.0 adds healthcare data to{" "}
              <code>onBinLookup</code>, validates an invalid
              <code>threeDSNotificationURL</code>{" "}
              in challenge tokens, uses stricter TypeScript callback types, and fixes{" "}
              <code>aria-checked</code> when
              <code>openFirstPaymentMethod=false</code>.
            </p>
          </section>
          <section id="webhooks">
            <h2>Webhooks, HMAC & idempotency</h2>
            <p>
              Verify HMAC before business processing, store the event durably, acknowledge it, then
              apply idempotent state transitions. Standard webhooks sign a canonical colon-separated
              field list; newer webhook families can sign the unchanged raw body in headers.
            </p>
            <p>
              Deduplication uses stable event identity, not arrival time. API mutations carry a UUID
              idempotency key capped at 64 characters. Late and out-of-order events update the same
              correlated aggregate.
            </p>
          </section>
          <section id="lifecycle">
            <h2>Capture, cancellation & refund</h2>
            <p>
              Capture is possible only for authorised, uncaptured methods that support separate
              capture. Cancellation applies before capture; refund applies after capture. Disabled
              actions remain visible with a reason in the Back Office.
            </p>
            <p>
              iDEAL and MB WAY do not support separate capture. They support refunds. PayPal is
              intentionally configured as settlement-only in this playground, even though other
              merchant configurations can support separate/partial capture.
            </p>

          <section id="partial">
            <h2>Partial payments and multiple attempts</h2>
            <p>
              Checkout <code>/orders</code>{" "}
              combines tenders such as a gift card followed by card. A remaining amount of zero is
              not sufficient to close: wait for all payments to reach final status and for{" "}
              <code>ORDER_CLOSED success=true</code>. Expired or manually cancelled orders close
              with <code>success=false</code>.

          </section>
          <section id="pbl">
            <h2>Pay by Link</h2>
            <p>
              Links default to 24 hours and can be configured up to 70 days. Adyen expires a link
              after five unsuccessful attempts. Therefore REFUSED is attempt-level; the order can
              remain open until the effective link status becomes completed or expired.

          <section id="mit">
            <h2>MIT & tokenization</h2>
            <p>
              Create tokens only after shopper consent. Subsequent merchant-initiated requests use
              <code>storedPaymentMethodId</code>, a non-PII <code>shopperReference</code>,
              <code>shopperInteraction=ContAuth</code>, and either
              <code>Subscription</code> or <code>UnscheduledCardOnFile</code>.

          <section id="pci">
            <h2>API Only & PCI</h2>
            <p>
              A custom form does not remove PCI obligations. Adyen Custom Card/Secured Fields keeps
              sensitive entry inside secure iframes and sends encrypted values. This server rejects
              raw PAN, CVC and security-code keys and never persists card payloads.
