# Security

These are TEST playgrounds. They are built so that a leaked screenshot, a forked repo or a public
URL costs you nothing — but they are not a PCI-certified platform and not a production secret store.

**If you fork this, read the checklist and nothing else is mandatory.**

## Forking checklist

1. **Never put LIVE credentials in it.** The app rejects LIVE endpoints and any client key that does
   not start with `test_`, but do not lean on that — treat it as a seatbelt, not a policy.
2. **Set `PROFILE_ENCRYPTION_KEY`** before deploying anywhere. It encrypts merchant profiles at
   rest, and it is required on Render.
3. **Set `PUBLIC_ORIGIN`** to the exact host browsers will use. It anchors the CSRF origin check;
   get it wrong and every mutation returns 403.
4. **Set `SESSION_SIGNING_SECRET`** to something random. It signs the session and CSRF cookies.
5. **Turn on `PLAYGROUND_BASIC_AUTH_USER` / `PLAYGROUND_BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD`** if the deployment is
   public. Basic Auth is optional and off by default.
6. **Rotate your Adyen TEST API key** if you ever pasted it somewhere shared.

Everything below explains why those exist and what they do not cover.

## What stays on the server

`ADYEN_API_KEY`, `ADYEN_HMAC_KEY`, `ADYEN_DEVICE_API_KEY`, the agentic bearer token and the webhook
Basic Auth credentials are read in `packages/platform/config.ts` and used only inside `api.ts` route
handlers. They are never imported from an island, so they cannot reach a browser bundle.

`ADYEN_CLIENT_KEY` is the one credential the browser needs. It is sent only when it starts with
`test_`.

The rule to keep: **anything under `islands/` is public**. If you add a secret, it belongs behind an
API route.

## Card data

Only Adyen Web Drop-in, Components, secured fields and stored-payment-method identifiers are used.
The card number, expiry and CVC live inside Adyen-hosted iframes and never touch this backend.

The API-only flow demonstrates the contract using Adyen's encrypted blobs. **Using it does not by
itself reduce your PCI obligations** — that depends on your integration and your assessor, not on
this repo.

`packages/platform/sanitize.ts` rejects anything that looks like a raw PAN or CVC before it can be
stored or logged. That is a backstop for a mistake, not a licence to send card data.

## Controls in place

**Credentials and configuration**

- LIVE endpoints and non-`test_` client keys rejected outright
- a permanent TEST badge and banner in the UI, so a screenshot is never ambiguous
- profiles encrypted with AES-256-GCM in SQLite
- the default profile comes only from environment variables and cannot be deleted from the UI
- the profile menu reports `configured` or which fields are missing, never the values

**Requests**

- signed, HttpOnly session cookie (`SameSite=Lax`, `Secure` over HTTPS)
- double-submit CSRF token on every `/api/*` mutation, with a same-host origin check
- optional Basic Auth over the whole playground
- in-memory rate limiter
- CSP and security headers on API responses

**Webhooks and replay**

- standard and header HMAC validation
- webhook deduplication and idempotent lifecycle actions, enforced by unique database constraints

**Logging**

- recursive redaction of sensitive keys, with payload truncation
- explicit rejection of raw card data

## Profiles and secrets

Profiles added through the UI are posted straight to the backend, encrypted, and never returned in
clear. Deleting one is irreversible.

Application-level encryption is not a secret manager. Restrict who can reach your hosting dashboard
and the persistent disk. Rotating `PROFILE_ENCRYPTION_KEY` means migrating or recreating every
encrypted profile — there is no automatic re-encryption.

## What this does not protect against

Stated plainly, so you can decide whether it matters for your fork:

- **The rate limiter is per-process.** Multiple replicas do not share counters.
- **SQLite and encrypted profiles do not fit multiple replicas** without coordination you would have
  to add yourself.
- **Platform logs, backups, operator access and DDoS protection are your host's job**, not this
  repo's.
- **CSRF protection assumes a same-site deployment.** Serving the API on a different origin than the
  UI needs a different design.
- **There is no authentication model beyond optional Basic Auth.** Anyone who can reach the URL can
  use the playground.

None of this is a reason to point it at LIVE credentials — including if you find a way around a
control listed above.

## Reporting something

If you find a problem in this repository, open an issue with enough detail to reproduce it. Do not
include real credentials in the report, TEST ones included.
