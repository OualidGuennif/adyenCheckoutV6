/**
 * `ssr.external` is only read by Vite's own resolver, and Fresh's Deno plugin
 * declares `enforce: "pre"` precisely to take that resolver's place. So during
 * `vite build` the Adyen library is resolved through Deno's loader and bundled
 * like everything else, which drags its CommonJS transport chain
 * (`https-proxy-agent` then `debug`) through the CJS-to-ESM conversion. That
 * conversion loses `debug`'s callable default export, and the built server dies
 * on import — before serving a single request — with
 * `TypeError: debug_1.default is not a function`.
 *
 * An external result returned by another plugin is the one form the Deno plugin
 * forwards untouched, so the bare specifier survives in the bundle and Deno
 * loads the package as CommonJS at runtime. That is the shape
 * `packages/platform/adyen.ts` already imports it in, and the one its tests
 * exercise outside Vite entirely.
